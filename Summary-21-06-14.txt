What have we done:

- Talked with 2 mentors to get a better picture of what we want to do.

Raya Yunakova said us that we should focus on teachers and how they are adding the whole information and data-base logic... etc.

Ivelin Mollov said us that we should focus on our presentation and student experience - how to evolve them to use our platform. We shoukd be attractive and funny. This is how we'll achieve victory here.

- Divided the problem to sub-problems.

- Made a couple of Mind maps about the project and presentation.

- Did some Front-end and THE JavaScript magic.

- Made a list of achievements and icons for them.
